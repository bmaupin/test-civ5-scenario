Just a place to track what's been done so far in this scenario, for my own personal reference:

1. Get an idea of area I want in map from Google Maps, take screenshot

1. Install [Yet (not) Another Earth Maps Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=77138438) mod

1. Start Civ 5 so files from mod get downloaded

1. Open biggest Europe map

1. Crop to area from Google Maps
