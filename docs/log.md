Just a place to track what's been done so far in this scenario, for my own personal reference:

#### Create map

1. Get an idea of area I want in map from Google Maps, take screenshot

1. Install [Yet (not) Another Earth Maps Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=77138438) mod

1. Start Civ 5 so files from mod get downloaded

1. Open biggest Europe map

1. Crop to area from Google Maps

1. Install Ukraine, Russia, Belarus mods

1. Add Civs to map in _Scenario Editor_

1. Set all map tiles to coast (for maximum contrast; maybe some kind of arctic terrain would've been better)

1. Take a screenshot of map

1. Add hex grid to Google Maps screenshot

   1. Open WorldBuilder screenshot with GIMP

   1. Set tile colour to transparent so we're just left with the hex grid

   1. Overlay hex grid on top of Google Maps screenshot

      1. Copy the hex grid

      1. Paste to Google Maps image

      1. Add paste as new layer

      1. Get image size

      1. Rescale hex grid to fit image using _Layer_ > _Scale Layer_

1. Set city locations

   - in a 29x29 grid (from bottom left corner)

     ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: These coordinates start with an index of 1, but I think WorldBuilder starts from 0? Double-check and update as needed.

1. Set game options

   - No City Razing
   - No Barbarians
   - No Ancient Ruins
   - Disable Religion

1. Set starting era for all civs to Information Era

1. Set Ukraine at war with Russia

1. Set start year to 2022

1. Disable Time, Science, Cultural victories

1. Create custom civ and leader (see below)

1. Create custom leader image (see below)

#### Create custom civilisation icon

Specs of the Civ 5 civilisation icons:

- Size: 256 x 256
- Image contains a centred circular icon surrounded by transparency
- Outer size of icon within image: 172 x 172
- Icon has a ~4 pixel solid colour border
  - So the inner circle within the icon is about 164 x 164

1. Look at existing icons to get an idea of the end product, e.g. https://www.sporcle.com/games/milc/civ-5-civilization-icons

   1. In particular, decide the primary and secondary colours

1. Download image you want to make icon from

1. Download icon template from here: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civilization-icon-template.534796/

1. Open with GIMP

1. Hide all but the background colour layer

1. Copy background colour of source image

1. Fill background colour in template with background colour of source image

   If the background is a circle:

   1. _Colors_ > _Colorize_

   1. Select the colour

   1. Set _Lightness_ to 0 or as desired

1. Go back to source image

1. Replace background colour with transparency

   1. Select the background colour with the colour picker tool

   1. _Colors_ > _Color to Alpha_

1. Select a rectangular portion of the source image and copy it

1. Paste into the template

   1. _Edit_ > _Paste As_ > _New Layer_

1. Resize the new layer to 149 x 149

1. Centre the new layer

   1. _Tools_ > _Transform Tools_ > _Align_

   1. In the left Align pane: _Relative to_ > _Image_

   1. Select the layer by clicking on it

   1. Click the button to centre horizontally, and the button to centre vertically

1. Resize oversized layers

   1. One of the layers is bigger than the image. Select it and then select _Layer_ > _Crop to Selection_. Otherwise the exported image will exceed the image bounds.

1. Remove full white layer and gradient layer with black circle

   - I'm not sure what the full white layer is for

   - The gradient layer with the black circle applies a gradient to the outer ring, which seems unnecesssary

1. Add transparency to the background layer

   I'm not sure if or why this is necesary, but doing this allowed the game to add the ring around the outside of the icon like it does for other civs

   1. Select the background layer

   1. Do a circle select

   1. Inverse the selection

   1. Press Delete to delete everything outside the selection

1. Create a new layer group

   üí° For a simpler solution, just do _Image_ > _Flatten Image_

   ‚ìò For whatever reason, when exporting images as DDS, only the selected layer gets exported. This moves all the layers we want into a group so they can all be exported.

   1. _Layer_ > _New Layer Group_

   1. In the layers panel on the right, drag each layer you want in the final image, starting from the bottom-most layer (this will ensure proper order)

1. Save the template as a new file

1. See below to use the custom image

#### Create dawn of man image

This is the image shown at the start of the game, and so it doesn't need to be created for AI-only civilisations

- Image should contain the leader, and the leader should be on the left half of the image
- Image should be 1024 x 768

#### Use custom image

1. Resize as appropriate; see here: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/icon-and-screen-pixel-dimension-reference.499400/

   1. First, resize the image

      _Image_ > _Canvas Size_

   1. Because DDS images are exported from the selected layer and not the image, the layer needs to be resized as well

      Right-click the layer > _Layer to Image Size_

1. Save as DDS

   1. _File_ > _Export As_

   1. Use the extension to `.dds` when saving

   1. _Format_ > _RGBA8_

   1. _Compression_> _DXT5_

‚ìò If you get errors exporting the image:

1.  Right-click the layer group > _Merge Layer Group_, then try exporting again

1.  If it's an image that requires multiple sizes (according to the link in the first step), create the other images from the first, e.g.

```
filename=NATO_
convert "${filename}256.dds" -resize 128x128 "${filename}128.dds"
convert "${filename}256.dds" -resize 80x80 "${filename}80.dds"
convert "${filename}256.dds" -resize 64x64 "${filename}64.dds"
convert "${filename}256.dds" -resize 45x45 "${filename}45.dds"
convert "${filename}256.dds" -resize 32x32 "${filename}32.dds"
```

1. Import into ModBuddy

   1. Right-click in the project > _Add_ > _Existing Item_

   1. Click on the `.dds` file and in the _Properties_ pane set _Import into VFS_ to _True_ (this must be done for all images)

      ‚ö†Ô∏è If you forget this part, you will get an error: "Unable to load texture"

#### Extract assets from Civ 5

This is useful to compare your assets with the ones from the game to make sure they're properly formatted

1. Download Dragon Unpacker: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/extracting-art-assets.536900/

1. Use Dragon Unpacker to extract the `.dds` and corresponding `-index.dds` file for the asset

1. Download CivDdsUnpacker from https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/dds-unpacker-for-interface-textures.389316/
